# MuxSpaces SDK

## Installation and Getting Started with the SDK

A step-by-step Getting Started guide for the SDK can be found [here](https://docs.mux.com/guides/video/send-and-receive-real-time-video-from-an-ios-application).

## Documentation

An Xcode DocC Archive with API documentation is included in the Documentation directory.

For more on how to start building with Mux real-time video see the Mux Video API real-time documentation [here](https://docs.mux.com/guides/video/build-real-time-video-experiences).

## Authentication

In order for clients to authenticate to a space, they need to 
provide a signed JSON Web Token, or JWT. This signed JWT is 
the way that the real-time client authenticates to a particular 
space.

[See the docs for more information](https://docs.mux.com/guides/video/build-real-time-video-experiences#4-sign-a-jwt).
